  # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080

  # forward a port
  # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest:8888, host:8888

  # using a specific IP.
  # config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10"
  config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "10.11.12.25"

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various
  # backing providers for Vagrant. These expose provider-specific options.
  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
  # config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
  #   # Don't boot with headless mode
  #   vb.gui = true
  #
  #   # Use VBoxManage to customize the VM. For example to change memory:
  #   vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "1024"]
  # end

  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--natdnshostresolver1", "on"]
    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--natdnsproxy1", "on"]
    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "1024"]

  # View the documentation for the provider you're using for more
  # information on available options.

  # Due to a problem with SSH forwarding on Windows machines,
  # the following config is needed.
